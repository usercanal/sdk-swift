- docs: Added CONTEXT events documentation in FEATURES.md

## August 13, 2025
Schema Optimisations, Session Management & Context Events

**Major Update**: Implemented comprehensive session management and context event system for iOS. All events now automatically include device_id + session_id with rich device context (battery, memory, screen info, etc.).

- feat: Added EventAdvanced struct with optional device_id, session_id, timestamp overrides
- feat: Added `client.eventAdvanced(event)` method for manual ID overrides
- feat: Added SessionManager with iOS app lifecycle integration
- feat: Added automatic device ID persistence in keychain
- feat: Added session timeout management with configurable intervals
- feat: Added context events for app state changes (background/foreground/active)
- feat: Added event_name and session_id fields to Event FlatBuffers schema
- feat: Added CONTEXT EventType for session/device context routing
- feat: Added protocol version support (PROTOCOL_VERSION_CURRENT = 100)
- feat: Added comprehensive EventAdvanced example with iOS-specific scenarios
- feat: Added sessionTimeout configuration parameter
- refactor: Updated FlatBuffers serialization to include event_name field
- refactor: Updated batch creation to include protocol version
- refactor: Event payload simplified - properties directly in payload (no event_name duplication)
- refactor: iOS events use device ID from keychain and session ID from SessionManager by default
- refactor: EventAdvanced allows explicit device/session ID overrides for proxy scenarios
- fix: Updated Event schema field ordering for optimal collector performance
- **BREAKING**: Event schema updated with new fields, iOS behavior changed for session management
